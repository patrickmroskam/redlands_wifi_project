# Redlands Wifi Project — state digest (PO working memory)

> Regenerable projection. Source of truth: GitHub (state) + decision-log (rationale).
> Cycle 1 was a **full rebuild** (digest absent on first product-owner run): all 23
> issues scanned, no delta watermark applied. Next full rebuild due at cycle 10.

## Cycle 3 delta (watermark 2026-09-18T07:39Z → 13:40Z): **empty (cycle 2's own writes only)**

The only issues touched since the watermark are #21 (07:43:39Z) and #17 (07:46:36Z) — both
cycle 2's own comments. `main` is at `9bb27d8`, cycle 2's own commit; **0 open PRs**; three
CI runs since the watermark, all green; site HTTP 200. The newest hub message is cycle 2's
own ask `msg_e812f339` (07:46:15Z), so **no owner reply of any kind has arrived** — the #30
ask has now been answered-but-not-actioned for ~22 h, and the #17 ask has been open ~6 h.
Both gates were re-run objectively (see the decision log) and both are still negative.

### Correction carried into this cycle

Cycles 1–2 recorded that the dev-team routine is off because *"there is no workable p0–p3
issue a dev-team run could pick up."* **That is wrong.** Three issues are open, unassigned,
and carry no `waiting` / `blocked` label: **#25** (p3, ingest — don't silently delete an
all-malformed log), **#29** (p3, map popup-pan edge cases), **#34** (p3, split the >1,000-line
e2e spec). None of them depends on #30 or #17. The routine is off because the constitution's
Human-in-the-loop protocol **step 4 requires it** ("Disable the dev-team routine… Do not pick
another issue. Exit.") for as long as any `waiting` issue is live — not because the backlog is
empty. The rule is being obeyed; only the stated reason was wrong. The consequence is real and
is now surfaced as an owner decision: the worker has been halted since 2026-09-17T15:05Z
(~22.5 h) with three shippable issues parked behind two gates that have no ETA.

## Site & map (PRD R1, R2)

- open: 1 (p0:0 p1:0 p2:0 p3:1), launch-blockers: 0, in-flight: 0
- notable: complete and live. **#29 (p3) is workable today and is parked by the protocol, not by a dependency.** Re-verified 2026-09-18 07:40Z: HTTP 200, 18,152 records served, `updated_at` + `count` top-level in the database and rendered at `assets/map.js:278` (**R2.5** ✅). Shipped #2 (scaffold + fenced map), #7 (retro polish + responsive), #11 (canvas renderer for ~18k markers), #12 (security pie), #13 (category list), #20 (footer credit). Only residual is #29 (p3, popup-pan edge cases). Verified live 2026-09-18 01:39Z: HTTP 200, 18,152 networks rendered, legend present, no third-party requests, CSP `default-src 'none'` with `script-src 'self'`.

## Ingest pipeline (PRD R3, R4)

- open: 2 (p0:0 p1:0 p2:1 p3:1), launch-blockers: 0, in-flight: 0
- notable: **#25 (p3) is workable today and is parked by the protocol, not by a dependency.** pipeline complete — #3 (parse/fence/dedupe/append/delete), #15 (canonical BSSID dedupe), #27 (`data/removed.json` denylist), #8 (backfill: +18,152 from 48 logs). 100 unit tests pass locally. `ingest/` holds only `README.md` + `.gitkeep`. **#30 (p2, `waiting`) is the project's single blocking issue** — the private raw-log inbox, owner-only setup; its three-part existence gate was re-run at cycle 2 (07:39Z) and is still **all negative** (no inbox repo, no `ingest` environment, 0 secrets). #25 (p3) is a residual.

## Automation / daily publish (PRD R5)

- open: 0 tracked directly, launch-blockers: 0, in-flight: 0
- notable: **the one unmet v1 Release Criterion.** `.github/workflows/ingest.yml` exists and is correct, but its `schedule` trigger is gated on `vars.INGEST_SCHEDULE == 'on'` and that variable does not exist (`actions/variables` → `total_count: 0`), so every scheduled run is skipped — confirmed in the Actions history ("Ingest wardrive logs" → *skipped*). The workflow comment attributes the flip to #8, which closed without setting it. Cycle 1 gave this last mile an owner by folding it into #30's acceptance (it must follow the inbox cutover so new logs never land in the public repo). Harmless today: `ingest/` is empty, so nothing is queued.

## Privacy & security (PRD R6, R7)

- open: 2 (p0:0 p1:0 p2:1 p3:1), launch-blockers: 0, in-flight: 0
- notable: **R4.12 spot-checked against the live published database at cycle 2** — all 18,152 records carry exactly `bssid, ssid, auth, channel, first_seen, lat, lon`; no RSSI, altitude, accuracy or raw-log field is published. #6 (privacy page) and #14 (security audit — vendored Leaflet, `'self'`-only CSP, injection tests) shipped. #22 carries an **open PO closure proposal** (`addressed-in-#30`): the owner answered option C and the work moved to #30, so the decision issue is spent. #21 (p3) is owner-only GitHub account settings, no ask ever sent.

## Hosting / custom domain (explicitly OUT of v1 scope)

- open: 1 (p0:0 p1:1 p2:0 p3:0), launch-blockers: 0, in-flight: 0
- notable: exposure **independently re-resolved at cycle 2 (07:38Z) and still live** — apex `A` still in the Pages range, `www` still CNAMEd, challenge TXT still absent, apex still 404, `repos/…/pages` → `cname: null`, `protected_domain_state: null`. Priority holds at p1. #17 was raised p2 → **p1** at cycle 1 for a live, independently re-verified security exposure: apex `A` records point at GitHub Pages (185.199.108-111.153) and `www` CNAMEs to `patrickmroskam.github.io`, but there is no `_github-pages-challenge-patrickmroskam` TXT, so the domain is unverified and unclaimed (`GET https://redlandswifiproject.com/` → 404 from Pages) — any GitHub user could claim it. Compounding it, the issue sits `waiting` on a `DONE custom-domain` reply **for which no OH HAI ask was ever sent** (its own 04:14Z comment says so): a silent deadlock. The p1 applies to the mitigation only; the domain switch itself remains out of v1 scope per the ratified PRD.

## Tests / CI (PRD R8)

- open: 1 (p0:0 p1:0 p2:0 p3:1), launch-blockers: 0, in-flight: 0
- notable: **#34 (p3) is workable today and is parked by the protocol, not by a dependency.** #4 shipped CI (Python 3.12 unit tests + Playwright chromium), ~40 s/run, SHA-pinned actions, green on the last 5 runs. #34 (p3) splits the >1,000-line e2e spec.

## Tracking

- #1 — v1 tracking issue, never assigned. Body was corrected at cycle 1 (spec status `draft` → ratified; R5 last mile added as an explicit unticked line); untouched at cycles 2 and 3.

## Closure activity (this period — project to date)

- proposed: 1 (#22, `addressed-in-#30`), closed: 14, contested: 0 — unchanged at cycle 3
- All 14 closes were dev-team ship-and-close, predating the PO. #22 is the first PO maker-checker proposal; its 48 h aging window runs to **2026-09-20T01:42Z**, so it does not close at cycle 3 either (cycle 4, ~2026-09-18T19:38Z, is still inside the window — first eligible pass is cycle 5, ~2026-09-20T07:38Z).
